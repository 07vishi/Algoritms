    <h1> What Is Algorithm. </h1>
    <img src="Algorithms.jfif" alt="Algorithm" style="height: 50%; width: 50%;">
    <p> 
        In programming, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules that must be followed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It serves as a blueprint for writing code to accomplish a well-defined objective. Algorithms in programming are crucial for designing efficient and effective solutions to various computational problems. </p>

    <h1> Logical structures </h1>
    <p>Logical structures refer to the organization and arrangement of ideas, information, or arguments in a way that follows a logical sequence or pattern. These structures are essential for effective communication, problem-solving, and reasoning. Various types of logical structures are commonly used in fields such as mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and linguistics. </p>
    <ol>
       <h2> <li>Sequential Structure:</li> </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Ideas or steps are presented in a chronological order or a step-by-step sequence. This structure is common in procedural writing and instructions. </p></li> </ul>

           <h2> <li> Hierarchical Structure: </li> </h2>
           <ul> <li> <p> Information is organized in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, showing the relationships between general categories and specific subcategories. It's often depicted as a tree diagram.        </li></ul> </p>

           <h2> <li> Parallel Structure </li></h2>
           <ul> <li> <p>Ideas are presented with equal importance and are usually connected by coordinating conjunctions. This structure is common in lists and comparisons. </p> </li> </ul>

           <h2> <li> Causal Structure: </li></h2>
           <ul> <li> <p> Describes cause-and-effect relationships. It explains how one event or condition leads to another.</p></li></ul>

           <h2><li> Problem-Solution Structure: </li></h2>
           <ul> <li> <p> Identifies a problem and then presents one or more solutions to address the issue. This structure is often used in persuasive writing or proposals.</p></li></ul>
           <h2> <li> Compare and Contrast Structure:</li></h2>
           <ul><li> <p> Highlights the similarities and differences between two or more items, concepts, or ideas. This structure is common in analytical writing.</p></li></ul>

           <h1> Design of diagrammatic structures. </h1>
           <p> When designing algorithmic structures in programming, diagrammatic representations can help visualize the flow and logic of the algorithm. Flowcharts and pseudocode are two common forms of diagrammatic structures used in algorithm design </p>
